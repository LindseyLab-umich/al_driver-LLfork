Realized model likely not working because harmonic angles require bond lengths to be fully decoupled from 3-body energy; ChIMES cannot do this
Recompiled with "make yes-user-yaff" to enable angle_style cross, which couples bonds and angles
Re-ran LAMMPS to generate initial training set with:
/home/rklinds/codes/chimes_calculator-myLLfork/etc/lmp/build/lammps_stable_29Oct2020/src/lmp_mpi_chimes -i in.lammps | tee out.lammps
python ~/codes/al_driver-myLLfork/src/lmp_to_xyz.py  REAL traj.200F.lammpstrj log.lammps
