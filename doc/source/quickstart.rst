Quick Start
#######################################

The ALD is a workflow tool that autonomously generates ChIMES models by orchestrating, running, and monitoring the various different tasks involved in iterative learning a model. By necessity, this involves generating input for, using, and post-processing output from several codes, download and installation of which are described in the following sections. 

.. Note ::

    System requirements for the ALD include: 


    * An HPC platform with job queueing - currently only SLURM/SBATCH systems are supported
    * C, C++11, and Fortran 77, 90, and 08 compilers
    * MPI compilers
    * MKL
    * Python version 3

    Note that the ALD is trivially extendable to other queuing sytems for all running modes except cluster-based active learning, and can be run without  cluster-based active learning support. See the "**<EXTENDING>**" page for additional details. 
    
    

==================================================
Installing ChIMES LSQ and ChIMES MD
==================================================

The ALD requires a specific version of the ChIMES LSQ/MD code. To download and compile it, log into your HPC system, execute the following commands, and agree to all prompted questions:

.. code-block :: bash

    cd /path/to/my/software/folder
    mkdir chimes_lsq-forALD
    git clone https://github.com/rk-lindsey/chimes_lsq.git chimes_lsq-forALD
    cd chimes_lsq-forALD
    ./install.sh

If the above instructions are followed properly, the following executables/scripts should be generated:

.. code-block :: bash

    ./build/chimes_lsq
    ./build/chimes_md-serial 
    ./build/chimes_md-mpi
    ./build/chimes_lsq.py
    ./build/post_proc_chimes_lsq.py
    ./contrib/dlars/src/dlars
    ./contrib/molanal/src/molanal.new

=============================================================
Installing Reference (Data Labeling) Methods
=============================================================

The ALD currently supports VASP and DFTB+ for data lableing (i.e. providing forces, energies, and stresses for configurations) in periodic system and Gaussian for non-periodic systems. Current implmentations are configured for the following software versions:

* VASP 5.4.1 (`link <https://www.vasp.at>`_)
* Gaussian 16 (`link <https://gaussian.com/gaussian16/>`_)
* DFTB+ 17.1 (`link <https://dftbplus.org/download/deprecated/dftb-171>`_)

Support for newer VASP and DFTB+ versions is in progress. Future efforts will also focus on supporting LAMMPS as a data labeling method, allowing, e.g., coarse-grained model development based on molecular mechanics potentials.

==================================================
Note on Correction Support
==================================================

The ALD currently supports generating ChIMES corrections for DFTB via DFTB+, however it requires an in-house compilation. Support via DFTB+/the ChIMES calculator is under development.
